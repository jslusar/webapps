    <p> 1.) Demonstrates how to concat strings with just a + or += both work.  Thus, Hello World! should be printed in the console.  If I uncomment += 'world', then the console prints Hello World World!.</p>
    <p> 2.) Demonstrates the different types of equality in javascript. The == is a loose equality, so it will do type conversion showing '4' does equal 4. So, if you don't want to do type conversion, then use the strict equality ===, which shows '4' dows NOT equal 4. (best practice is to use the ===)</p>
    <p> 3.) Demonstrates that false, null, undefined, "", 0, and NaN are all considered FALSE. On the other hand, "any string", 1, -1, and true are all considered TRUE.</p>
    <p> 4.) Demonstrates how to write a for loop in javascript. If you change a var in a for loop, then when you use it again outside of the for loop it will be the changed variable, which is why in the example the console prints 45 for sum instead of 0.</p>
    <p> 5.) Demonstrates that you can't compare two obkects, you have to write your own code to do that, and the ? is an inline if statement.</p>
